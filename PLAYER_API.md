# Player API, protocol version 1

Implement one Python class derived from `src.player.Player`. One instance lives for the whole match, independently for each seat. Do not implement JSON transport yourself; the SDK host handles it. Uploads must be trusted local code: resource/process limits are implemented, but filesystem and network access are not isolated.

## Getting the SDK

From the Catan Simulator **My bots** page, choose **Add player version**, then select **Download Player SDK**. The ZIP contains this guide, the public `src.player` interface, and a small starter file under `examples/my_player.py`.

Extract the ZIP into a new folder, edit `examples/my_player.py`, and keep the included `src` folder beside it so the import `from src.player import Player` works locally. When ready, upload your `.py` file from the same **Add player version** dialog. The website validates it and saves it as an immutable version owned by your account.

```python
from src.player import Player

class MyPlayer(Player):
    def on_game_start(self, view):
        self.production = {}

    def on_event(self, event):
        if event.type == 'ResourcesProduced':
            for resource, count in event.data.resources.items():
                key = (event.player_id, resource)
                self.production[key] = self.production.get(key, 0) + count

    def choose_action(self, view, options):
        # This is only a sketch: Discard and Trade require filled-in fields.
        return options[0]

    def on_game_end(self, result):
        pass
```

Use `examples/my_player.py` for a complete runnable baseline that handles all decisions. `src/player/example.py` contains its simple deterministic strategy. Neither is intended as a competitive strategy.

## Methods and ordering

- `choose_action(view, options)` is the only decision method and must be overridden.
- `on_event(event)` is invoked separately for every visible event. The default is a no-op. Its return value is ignored.
- `on_game_start(view)` and `on_game_end(result)` are optional no-op lifecycle hooks.
- After a legal action, the engine commits the change, publishes its ordered events, finishes delivering them to all eligible players, then asks for the next decision.
- No methods run concurrently on the same player. Your callbacks may update your own memory, but cannot act on the game except by returning an action from `choose_action`.
- Trade responses and discards may require a decision during another player's turn. `view.player_id` is always your identity; `view.turn.current_player` is the owner of the turn.
- Final events are delivered before `on_game_end`. A callback failure is recorded; already committed changes are not rolled back because a listener failed.

Views, options and events are detached immutable mappings with attribute access. Nested sequences are tuples. `value['key']` and `value.key` both work. Use `src.player.thaw(value)` to create a mutable ordinary dict/list copy. All public IDs and enum values are strings, identical locally and through the process adapter.

## Observation

`view` contains:

- `protocol_version`, `game_id`, `player_id`, `decision_id`.
- `self`: own resource/development-card maps; newly purchased development cards; piece supplies; resource/card counts; knights; achievements; total own score.
- `opponents`: public **total card counts**, piece supplies, played knights, achievements and public scores. An opponent has `resource_count`, but never a `resources` map. The view does not reveal how many wood, brick, sheep, wheat, or ore cards an opponent holds.
- `board.tiles`: resource, number, robber flag, surrounding vertex/edge IDs.
- `board.vertices`: coordinates, neighboring vertices, edges, tiles, port, owner and building type.
- `board.edges`: endpoints and owner; `board.ports`: type and endpoints; `board.robber_tile`.
- `bank`: remaining resource counts; `development_deck_count`: remaining deck size, never order or composition.
- `turn`: `number`, `current_player`, `game_phase`, decision `phase`, and dice total if rolled.
- `trade`: pending proposal and eligible agreements, or null.

Resource names: `WOOD`, `BRICK`, `SHEEP`, `WHEAT`, `ORE`. Development cards: `KNIGHT`, `ROAD_BUILDING`, `YEAR_OF_PLENTY`, `MONOPOLY`, `VICTORY_POINT`.

The game seed is not sent to players because it would disclose future random outcomes. It is saved in the finished recording and private audit. There is no raw `GameState` in a view.

Only `view.self.resources` contains an exact hand. If you want an estimate of another player's hand, keep your own model from public events such as `ResourcesProduced`, builds, discards, bank trades, and player trades. Hidden theft details and other private information are never added to an opponent entry. The finished spectator replay may reveal all hands for playback, but that replay is produced only after simulation and is never passed to players.

## Actions

Usually return one of `options` unchanged. Locations and resource combinations are concrete legal choices, refreshed after every action. Only `TRADE`, `COUNTER` and `DISCARD` are templates you fill in. Extra fields and unavailable actions are rejected.

| Type | Fields / meaning |
|---|---|
| `PLACE_SETTLEMENT` | `vertex`; initial setup |
| `PLACE_ROAD` | `edge`; road adjoining the just-placed settlement |
| `ROLL` | Mandatory before post-roll actions |
| `BUILD_ROAD` | `edge` |
| `BUILD_SETTLEMENT` | `vertex` |
| `BUILD_CITY` | `vertex`; replaces own settlement |
| `BUY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD` | Draws one hidden card |
| `PLAY_DEVELOPMENT_CARD` | `card`; enters another decision context |
| `MOVE_ROBBER` | `tile`, `victim` (player ID or null) |
| `BUILD_FREE_ROAD` | `edge`; Road Building calls this up to twice, recalculating legality |
| `TAKE_RESOURCES` | `resources` map; offered Year of Plenty choices |
| `TAKE_MONOPOLY` | `resource` |
| `BANK_TRADE` | `give_resource`, `receive_resource`, `ratio`; ratio computed by engine |
| `TRADE` | Player fills `recipients`, `give`, `receive` |
| `ACCEPT`, `REJECT` | Response to the current original offer |
| `COUNTER` | Responder fills `give`, `receive` from their own perspective |
| `SELECT_TRADE` | `response`; index into `view.trade.responses` |
| `CANCEL_TRADE` | Completes negotiation without transfer |
| `DISCARD` | Option supplies `count`; return `resources` with exactly that total, omitting `count` |
| `END_TURN` | Available only after required turn decisions finish |

Example proposal:

```python
return {
    'type': 'TRADE',
    'recipients': ['P2', 'P3'],
    'give': {'WOOD': 2},
    'receive': {'ORE': 1},
}
```

The simulator offers only `{'type': 'TRADE'}`; it never enumerates proposals. Give/receive maps must be nonempty positive integer amounts with no resource on both sides. You must hold your offered cards. Recipients are distinct other players. They respond in seat-ID order, once each; everyone sees the proposal and responses. A counter is from the responder's perspective. Final response entries normalize give/receive back to the proposer's perspective. The proposer chooses one executable agreement or cancels. The simulator revalidates both hands before transferring. No recursive counter round; a new proposal is allowed afterward.

Discard example: `{'type': 'DISCARD', 'resources': {'WOOD': 2, 'SHEEP': 1}}` when the offered count is three.

## Events

An event contains `sequence`, `type`, `player_id`, `turn_number`, and `data`. Global sequence gaps are expected when private events are omitted. Event data is described by the emitting operation:

| Events | Data |
|---|---|
| `GameStarted` | clockwise seat order |
| `TurnStarted`, `TurnEnded` | turn owner in event `player_id` |
| `DiceRolled` | `die1`, `die2`, `total` |
| `ResourcesProduced` | exact `resources` map; optional `setup` |
| `SettlementBuilt`, `CityBuilt`, `RoadBuilt` | `vertex` or `edge`; optional `setup` / `free` |
| `TradeOffered`, `TradeResponse`, `TradeCompleted`, `TradeCancelled` | proposal/response data or completed exchange |
| `BankTradeCompleted` | `give`, `receive` |
| `DevelopmentCardPurchased` | occurrence only; no identity |
| `DevelopmentCardPlayed` | public `card` |
| `ResourcesTaken`, `MonopolyResolved` | resource selection / per-player amounts |
| `CardsDiscarded` | public `count` only |
| `RobberMoved`, `ResourceStolen` | destination/victim; theft participants |
| `AchievementChanged` | achievement and new owner or null |
| `GameWon`, `GameEnded` | winner/revealed winning score and result |
| Private `DevelopmentCardDrawn`, `DiscardDetails`, `TheftDetails` | own draw, own discard, stolen-card identity for thief and victim |

You may ignore events or maintain any inference model you like. Opponent hand contents are never supplied directly. The public replay reveals the winner's score at completion; other hidden VP remain private.

## Running and validating

```powershell
python -m src.simulator.run --seed 42 --replay match.json
python -m src.simulator.run --seed 42 --player examples/my_player.py --player examples/my_player.py --player examples/my_player.py --player examples/my_player.py --replay match.json
```

Zero `--player` arguments use four example players. Four files use persistent processes. `--max-turns` overrides the default 1000-turn limit. `--audit private-audit.json` saves private decisions/events for local debugging; never publish that file as a replay.

The web upload verifies import, one subclass, protocol version, construction, lifecycle/event handling and an initial legal decision. This smoke test cannot prove the strategy handles every later situation.

Process callbacks default to a two-second limit. Messages are limited to 2 MB and diagnostic retention to 16 KB. Windows Job Objects cap each submitted player at one process, 256 MB combined memory and 30 seconds of CPU over its lifetime; closing the job kills its process tree. POSIX uses process groups and resource limits. The platform also caps each match at 180 seconds. These local execution limits are not network/filesystem security.

Invalid decisions or callback failures end competitive matches with `player_failed` (shown as failed in the web catalog); no silent replacement strategy is used. Operational limits produce `stopped`, not a winner. Direct in-process execution is for trusted code and does not enforce callback timeouts.

Old `take_turn` / per-card callbacks and the former input-file script protocol are incompatible. Existing files/versions are preserved, but authors must submit a new version implementing this API.
